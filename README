You should build this distribution by 

?) Starting a virtualenvironment (optional but strongly recommended)
1) Running pip install -I -r /path/to/Requirments.txt (gets the required modules)
2) copy spacechem.cfg.example > spacechem.cfg AND add appropriate values (especially for the database)
3) copy spacechem.wsgi.example > spacechem.wsgi AND change the path to reflect the location of your spacechem folder
4) Run spacechem.py by using python (on windows, you might want to do this using IDLE or IPython to see bug reports) 

That's it for now folks!
